  BASE LAYER
  These are the foundational styles for your entire application.
  - We set scroll-behavior to smooth for anchor links (#).
  - We define the default background, text color, font, and anti-aliasing for the body.
  - We set a custom color for text selection for a branded feel.
  (These assume 'background' and 'text' colors are defined in your tailwind.config.cjs)

/*
  COMPONENTS LAYER
  This layer is intentionally left empty.
  In our upgraded application, all component styles are now applied
  directly in the JSX files using Tailwind's utility classes. This is a
  modern best practice that makes components more self-contained and
  easier to manage, as you don't have to jump between CSS and JS files.
*/

/*
  UTILITIES LAYER
  These are custom utility styles. Styling the browser scrollbar
  is a great example of a global utility that enhances the UI.
